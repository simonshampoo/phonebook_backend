# phonebook_backend

Looks like I committed the whole app-- nothing meaningful is here. Whoops. 


Full-stack application using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose with fully functioning REST api @ https://simon-phonebook-backend.herokuapp.com/api/persons and https://simon-phonebook-backend.herokuapp.com/api/persons/<contact id> and CRUD abilities.
